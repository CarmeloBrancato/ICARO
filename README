icaro software, is a software that allows the Computer Forensics expert, to extract from the email headers, all the information that allows to identify a subject that is committing a potential crime.
The software is designed for GNU / LINUX systems

Its operation is of sequential type, as for each extraction operation, localization of the IP and tracking performs a checksum SHA256 and MD5 of each extraction.

The checksum serves to demonstrate the consistency of data and copies.
Icaro, also allows you to compress the directory of the finds and can be signed with the digital signature to validate the chain of custody.

It has the ability to create an iso image with all the files to be burned on a DVD or CD ROM, in order to deliver it to the Judicial Authority.
